        <h1>8x CrossFit Games Competitor </h1>
        <h1> Owner of CrossFit Omaha & Go Far Fitness</h1>
       <!-- <h1>Writer Omaha World HeraldLive Well Nebraska</h1>-->
           
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Stacie Tovar is a true country girl at heart.
                
                She was raised on a farm outside of a small town in North East, Nebraska with a population of 700 people. As the second oldest, Stacie worked on her family farm alongside her two sisters, Michelle and Kelli, and brother, Steve. The farm life wasn't always glamorous. It consisted of long, hard days that never seemed to end. But was a simple way of life that taught her to work hard and have patience - patience to accept what was, what is and what will be. <br><br>
                
                This lifestyle naturally led her to being active outside with her siblings. And on a farm, your siblings are all you have. With this, there was always the normal sibling rivalry and competitions – who could run the fastest, finish the farm chores the quickest, or be the best tractor driver. It was all healthy competition that would later serve her as an individual and athlete. <br><br>
                
                In school, Stacie was inherently athletic and fiercely competitive. Often beating the boys in her class in most activities. During high school, she was a multi-sport athlete and standout volleyball and track athlete. She received scholarship offers in both sports and went on to accept an opportunity to play volleyball at the University of Nebraska Omaha. After four years of undergrad and collegiate volleyball, she graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education. <br><br>
                
                In 2008, a year after graduating college, Stacie found CrossFit. Her boyfriend at the time, Dustin Tovar, had to convince her to give it a go. Her first workout was nothing short of unforgettable. It involved deadlifts and box jumps. She couldn't finish the workout even after she scaled the weights and movements. Despite the outcome of this "first WOD" experience, she was hooked. Little did she know what this would later turn in to. <br><br>
                
                Only after a year of starting CrossFit she qualified for the 2009 CrossFit Games. Oh, how things have changed since then. But it wasn't a fluke, she continued to qualify for the CrossFit Games in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. <br><br>
                
                October of 2013 is when her competitive fire exploded. She left her corporate job to pursue her new-found passion: becoming a full-time CrossFit Games athlete. It turned out to be the best decision she's ever made (besides marriage of course). <br><br> 
                
                In 2014, she missed going to the Games by one spot. This lit a fire within her that led her to qualify for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 CrossFit Games. <br><br>
                
                Shortly after qualifying for the 2017 CrossFit Games, she was invited back to her Alma Mater to receive a Distinguished Alumni Award from the university's, College of Education. This same year Stacie decided to retire from competing in CrossFit. After her last workout at the 2017 CrossFit Games, Stacie eloquently left her shoes on the floor and stepped away from competition. The sell-out crowd in Madison, WI gave her an unforgettable standing ovation that will forever be remembered in CrossFit Games history. <br><br>
                
                Throughout her career as a CrossFit Games athlete, Stacie is celebrated for her drive, tenacity, and for redefining Beauty Beyond Strength. <br><br>
                
                Now enjoying the next phase of her career, Stacie has shifted her focus to improving fitness and wellness in others. She is a coach, affiliate owner, businesswoman, and mom. As a coach and affiliate owner at CrossFit Omaha, she strives to take her community farther through fitness and nutrition by creating an atmosphere that is welcoming to all. As a businesswoman and owner of Go Far Fitness, online fitness plans, she aims to provide a home for ANYONE looking to further their fitness through daily workouts, FUNctional programming, educational tips, nutrition, community, and more. <br><br>
                
                When she's not working or working out, you'll find her spending time with her husband, Dustin (remember, that guy that showed her CrossFit, that's him), newborn son, Gavin, and 70lb Double-Doodle pup, Louden. If the sun is shining, you'll most likely find her outside being active, sunbathing, grilling, or relaxing with some family at the lake. </p>
                
               
                 <h2>Words from Stacie</h2>
                 <p>As a professional CrossFit athlete, my goals were always constant – compete at the highest level possible, have fun doing it, and continue to be a positive force in the CrossFit community. When it was all said and done, I wanted to be remembered as a hardworking, talented athlete who wholeheartedly cherished the CrossFit lifestyle and community. As well as someone who contributed towards the movement that helped redefine strength and beauty for females. Ultimately, I was determined to leave my mark on the sport by always striving to embody the CrossFit spirit. <br><br>
                
                    Now that I'm retired from competition, my goals remain the same. As long as I can still make an impact I want to hold myself to these same high standards and help others along the way. I want to motivate women and men alike to be better versions of themselves. Most of all, I want to inspire others to embrace the outcome of their own hard work. I encourage everybody that comes into contact with FUNctional fitness to take pride in their efforts and enjoy the journey to health and wellness. <br><br>
                        
                    Always appreciate the process and daily efforts. You can change if you want to change.

The sell-out crowd in Madison, WI gave her an unforgettable standing ovation that will forever be remembered in CrossFit Games history. <br><br>
                    
                    Throughout her career as a CrossFit Games athlete, Stacie is celebrated for her drive, tenacity, and for redefining Beauty Beyond Strength. <br><br>
                    
                    Now enjoying the next phase of her career, Stacie has shifted her focus to improving fitness and wellness in others. She is a coach, affiliate owner, businesswoman, and mom. As a coach and affiliate owner at CrossFit Omaha, she strives to take her community farther through fitness and nutrition by creating an atmosphere that is welcoming to all. As a businesswoman and owner of Go Far Fitness, online fitness plans, she aims to provide a home for ANYONE looking to further their fitness through daily workouts, FUNctional programming, educational tips, nutrition, community, and more. <br><br>
                    
                    When she's not working or working out, you'll find her spending time with her husband, Dustin (remember, that guy that showed her CrossFit, that's him), newborn son, Gavin, and 70lb Double-Doodle pup, Louden. If the sun is shining, you'll most likely find her outside being active, sunbathing, grilling, or relaxing with some family at the lake.</p>
                    
                   
                     <h2>Words from Stacie</h2>
                     <p>As a professional CrossFit athlete, my goals were always constant – compete at the highest level possible, have fun doing it, and continue to be a positive force in the CrossFit community. When it was all said and done, I wanted to be remembered as a hardworking, talented athlete who wholeheartedly cherished the CrossFit lifestyle and community. As well as someone who contributed towards the movement that helped redefine strength and beauty for females. Ultimately, I was determined to leave my mark on the sport by always striving to embody the CrossFit spirit.  <br><br>
                    
                        Now that I'm retired from competition, my goals remain the same. As long as I can still make an impact I want to hold myself to these same high standards and help others along the way. I want to motivate women and men alike to be better versions of themselves. Most of all, I want to inspire others to embrace the outcome of their own hard work. I encourage everybody that comes into contact with FUNctional fitness to take pride in their efforts and enjoy the journey to health and wellness.  <br><br>
                            
                        Always appreciate the process and daily efforts. You can change if you want to change.
